      <b>Our Mission:</b>
      <p>
      We wanted to make a game that teaches people where to put their waste. Many people, if they
      don't know where to throw things away, will just throw it in the trash, instead of recycling
      or composting.
      <p>
      <b>Instructions:</b>
      <p>
      To play, simply sort the trash into the right bins. If you're not sure where to sort things
      in real life or in the game, simply check the trash-dex.
      <p>
      <b>ENJOY!</b>
