# Catch the Trash Game

## Our Mission:

We wanted to make a game that teaches people where to put their waste. Many people, if they
don't know where to throw things away, will just throw it in the trash, intead of recycling
or composting.

## Instructions:

To play, simply sort the trash into the right bins. If you're not sure where to sort things
in real life or in the game, simply check the trash-dex.

ENJOY!
