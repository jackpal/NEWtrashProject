<h1>Catch the Trash</h1>
This educational iPhone/iPad action game teaches you where to put your waste.
<p>
To play, simply drag the falling trash into the right bins. If you're not sure
where to sort things in real life or in the game, simply check the included
trash-dex.
<p>
This game was made by four girls who met at a
<a href="https://girlswhocode.com/campus-iphone/">Girls Who Code</a> course.
They learned to program in Swift, and made the game during their two weeks
course.
